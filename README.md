## What is Laser Tag?

Laser tag is a tag game played with guns which fire infrared beams. Infrared-sensitive targets are located inside the gun of each player. Since its birth in 1979, with the release of the Star Trek Electronic Phasers toy manufactured by the South Bend Electronics brand of Milton Bradley, laser tag has evolved into both indoor and outdoor styles of play, and may include simulations of combat, role play-style games, or competitive sporting events including tactical configurations and precise game goals.
